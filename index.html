            Jawaharlal Nehru had a largely Western upbringing. As a boy, he was homeschooled in India, mostly by a series of English governesses and tutors. He continued his education in England, at the Harrow School in London and at Trinity College, Cambridge.Jawaharlal Nehru was an Indian independence activist and, subsequently, the first Prime Minister of India, as well as a central figure in Indian politics both before and after independence. The first was Jawaharlal Nehru of the Indian National Congress party, who was sworn in on 15 August 1947, when India gained independence from the British Raj. Serving until his death in May 1964, Nehru remains India's longest-serving prime minister.Jawaharlal Nehru has been targeted of awarding Bharat Ratna to himself while serving as Prime Minister of India in 1955. This claim is not completely true as the then President of India, Rajendra Prasad confessed to have decided to confer this award on Nehru suo motu.Jawaharlal Nehru was a key leader of the Indian National Congress and the independence movement. He often balanced the religiosity and traditionalism of Mahatma Gandhi with a more secular and modernist perspective, thus broadening the appeal of the movement. In 1947 he became India's first prime minister and served until his death in 1964.Jawaharlal Nehru helped lead India to independence, which ended the British raj. As India's first prime minister, he worked to make India an important member of the international community. He dislodged the Portuguese from Goa but was less successful in disputes with China over Arunachal Pradesh and with Pakistan over Kashmir.
